# New_beginning
After a few weeks of pause I returned to Python...
So, as I finished my CODE:ME Python course I've made myself some holidays... 
Now the time came to start again, from the beginning and learn more about Python.
Hope to write some good code and start a new beginning ;)

Beginnings are hard...

Now as I need some utility to solve a problem with str files for my FPV system, I started a new project, str editor.
